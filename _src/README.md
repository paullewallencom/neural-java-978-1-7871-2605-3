# Neural Network Programming with Java Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Neural Network Programming with Java Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/neural-network-programming-java-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787126053) By Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book

Want to discover the current state-of-art in the field of neural networks that will let you understand and design new strategies to apply to more complex problems? This book takes you on a complete walkthrough of the process of developing basic to advanced practical examples based on neural networks with Java, giving you everything you need to stand out.

You will first learn the basics of neural networks and their process of learning. We then focus on what Perceptrons are and their features. Next, you will implement self-organizing maps using practical examples. Further on, you will learn about some of the applications that are presented in this book such as weather forecasting, disease diagnosis, customer profiling, generalization, extreme machine learning, and characters recognition (OCR). Finally, you will learn methods to optimize and adapt neural networks in real time.

All the examples generated in the book are provided in the form of illustrative source code, which merges object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and neural network features to enhance your learning experience.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders, code files are available for Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4 and project file. For example, Chapter 1. 

You will see code something similler to the following:

```
     # public class HiddenLayer extends NeuralLayer {
    
    /**
     * HiddenLayer constructor
     * 
     * @param numberofneurons Number of neurons in this hidden layer
     * @param iaf Activation Function for all neurons in this layer
     * @param numberofinputs Number of inputs in this layer
     * @see HiddenLayer
     */
    public HiddenLayer(int numberofneurons,IActivationFunction iaf,
            int numberofinputs){
        super(numberofneurons,iaf);
        numberOfInputs=numberofinputs;
        init();
    }
```
### Note

The NeuralNetWithJava_2nd.zip file should be in zip format as it contains the project.
